      <h2>Definitions to Key words in JavaScript</h2>
      <h4 id="item1">JavaScript</h4>
      <p class="class-p1" >an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</p>
      <h4 id="item2">operator</h4>
      <p class="class-p2">The typeof operator evaluates to "number", "string", or "boolean" if its operand is a number, string, or boolean<br>
         value and returns true or false based on the evaluation. Here is a list of the return values for the typeof Operator. Type. String <br>
         Returned by typeof. Number.</p>
      <h4 id="item3">variable</h4>
      <p class="class-p3">Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container. Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the var keyword as follows.</p>
      <h4 id="item4">Variable naming conventions</h4>
      <p class="class-p4">Coding conventions are style guidelines for programming</p>
      <h4 id="item5">Functions</h4>
      <p class="class-p5">Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</p>
      <h4 id="item6">Strings</h4>
      <p class="class-p6">a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation).</p>
      <h4 id="item7">Methods</h4>
      <p class="class-p7">A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.</p>
      <h4 id="item8">Arguments</h4>
      <p class="class-p8">The arguments object is a local variable available within all functions. You can refer to a function's arguments within the function by using the arguments object.</p>
      <h4 id="item9">Parameters</h4>
      <p class="class-p9">a numerical or other measurable factor forming one of a set that defines a system or sets the conditions of its operation.</p>
      <h4 id="item10">Chaining methods</h4>
      <p class="class-p10">Method chaining is a technique that can be used to simplify code in scenarios that involve calling multiple functions on the same object consecutively.</p>
      <h4 id="item11">Boolean</h4>
      <p class="class-p11">a binary variable, having two possible values called “true” and “false.”</p>
      <h4 id="item12">Undefined</h4>
      <p class="class-p12">In JavaScript there is Undefined (type), undefined (value) and undefined (variable). Undefined (type) is a built-in JavaScript type. undefined (value) is a primitive and is the sole value of the Undefined type. Any property that has not been assigned a value, assumes the undefined value.</p>
      <h4 id="item13">Nan</h4>
      <p class="class-p13">The NaN property represents "Not-a-Number" value. This property indicates that a value is not a legal number</p>
      <h4 id="item14">Escape</h4>
      <p class="class-p14">escape() function computes a new string in which certain characters have been replaced by a hexadecimal escape sequence.</p>
      <h4 id="item15">Alert</h4>
      <p class="class-p15">The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button.An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.</p>
      <h4 id="item16">Comments</h4>
      <p class="class-p16">JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code</p>
      <h4 id="item17">jQuery</h4>
      <p class="class-p17">Query is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License.</p>
      <h4 id="item18">Attributes</h4>
      <p class="class-p18">Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.</p>
      <h4 id="item119">Return</h4>
      <p class="class-p19">In JavaScript, return statements cease execution in a function and return a value to the caller; JavaScript functions require an explicit return statement for returning the result of an expression (the value) from a function.</p>
